                        The blue tang is one of the most popular fish in the marine aquarium trade. However, it cannot
                        be
                        easily bred in captivity. This creates a global supply chain that connects fishermen in small
                        islands with hobby aquarists on the other
                        side of the world.

                        Alongside four additional team members I worked in Indonesia, the Philippines, and Colorado to
                        trace
                        the path of this supply chain. I also developed the technology for the project, creating a web
                        experience to tell a map-driven multimedia story, capturing underwater virtual reality video,
                        and
                        drone support.

                        People across the country explore their environments every day, but their stories are rarely
                        heard. I created the Ice Cream Expedition, to start a conversation with kids (and adults) about
                        where they love to explore, and how they can protect these places.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Along with two others, I drove an ice cream truck more than 8,600 miles across the country
                        serving more than 13,000 free scoops of unique ice cream flavors. Along the way, we collected
                        1,300 handwritten pledges from people across the country describing what they loved about their
                        favorite natural areas, and how they could help protect them.

                    <p>
                        To support the expedition and fund converting a delivery van into an ice cream truck, we ran a
                        <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/347656150/ice-cream-expedition/"> successful
                            kickstarter campaign</a> and partnered with sponsors. Working with PR groups from National
                        Geographic Kids and <a href="https://www.magnoliaicecream.com/">Magnolia Ice Cream</a> we
                        created 19 events at parks, museums, and schools across the country.

                        Reaching above 18,000' deep in the Indian Himalayas lies the highest road in the world. Every
                        winter this road is destroyed by avalanches, rockslides, and flooding. Every spring workers come
                        to the Jammu-Kashmir region from throughout India to rebuild the road.

                        This project was led by <a href="http://cameronwkruse.com/">Cameron Kruse</a>. I was responsible
                        for developing the technology to capture spherical videos and photos for viewing in virtual
                        reality.

                        we launched a balloon 85,000 feet into the stratosphere to observe the 2017 solar eclipse. From
                        this vantage, we watched the shadow of the moon trace the path of totality over the earth.

                    <p>
                        We launched two balloons, one in Wyoming, and the other in Oregon. Each balloon was equipped
                        with a custom-built radio tracking system and a downlink to stream images live from the balloon.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In addition to capturing traditional photos and video, one balloon also carried a camera for
                        capturing spherical video. From this, we produced a <a

                        they were carried by the balloon.
