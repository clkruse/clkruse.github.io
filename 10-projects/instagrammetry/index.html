                    <div class="article">
                        <h5>project goal</h5>
                        <p>
                            At popular landmarks, people take and share photos that are nearly identical aside from
                            slight
                            shifts in perspective. In this project, I used images from instagram of a common landmark
                            taken
                            from different positions to create a 3D model.
                        </p>

                        <h5>methods</h5>
                        <p>
                            As is a common theme, data is key for this project. I wanted to use images posted on social
                            media since it is is a fully unexpected way that your semi-personal data might be used, and
                            that it represents the collective view of a landmark.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            For this proof of concept, I needed to find a landmark that was common enough to appear in
                            public instagram photos, and also a subject that people would capture in a photo. At many
                            landmarks, people take a selfie and either tag the location or add a hashtag, but this image
                            is not useful for reconstructing the geometry of the landmark. I settled on the Statue of
                            Liberty, as it's geometry is more self-contained than other landmarks, and because it seems
                            that people more frequently capture the statue in photos tagged at that location. I manually
                            scraped 56 public images from instagram that clearly showed the statue.

        <div class="container-fluid">
            <div class="row justify-content-center">
                <div class="col-lg-8 col-md-10 col-sm-12">
                    <img src="instagram_images.jpg">

                    <p>
                        To process the images, I used a technique called photogrammetry. Here, feature points are
                        identied in each image. These features are then compared against the features in other
                        images. If they match, then the photos and subject can be referenced relative to one
                        another. This process simultaneously solves for the position where the photo was taken, and
                        also the 3D geometry of the shared subject. For this project, I used a program called <a
                            href="https://www.agisoft.com/">Metashape</a> for the photogrammetry processing.

                    <p>
                        While the output is far from a pixel perfect 3D model, I find it to be a compelling artistic
                        representation of an object seen from the perspective of many different people.

                    <h5>conclusion</h5>
                    <p>
                        I had anticipated that this project would take more of a form of crunching through huge
                        numbers of photos in order to create a precise 3D model from public data. Instead, I found
                        that the process was more artistic and subjective. The photos needed to be more highly
                        curated, and the outputs were not precisely correct. However, I found the notion of building
                        and combining a shared 3D model from a number of different spatial and temporal perspectives
                        to be compelling. I think a more refined version of these models could be very artistically
                        interesting.
                    </p>

                    <ul>

                            Manually align key points in images to help with registration and quality of the model.

                        <li>
                            Make the texture blending sample from more images representively rather than just from
                            the "best" image data.
