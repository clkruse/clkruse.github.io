                    <h5>the problem</h5>
                    <p>
                        I've been doing a lot more birdwatching during the coronavirus quarantine. In the last month,
                        I've seen 33 different species according to <a href="http://ebird.org/">eBird</a>. It's
                        impressive that in a single location, there can be so many clearly distinguishable species.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My aim for the day was to create a chart of birds ordered by visual similarity. It would be
                        interesting to see different edges of the spectrum of bird diversity, and how the bird species
                        smoothly morph between extremes.
                    </p>

                    <h5>methods</h5>
                    <p>
                        Proper datasets are key to this project. Because we're analyzing image data, birds in front
                        of different backgrounds, at different scales, or even in different positions could throw
                        off the similarity comparison. I wanted to use illustrations from <a
                            href="https://www.sibleyguides.com/">Sibley's Guides to Birds</a> but couldn't find a
                        large collection of images online. Instead, I used ~2,500 images from <a
                            href="https://joelsartore.com/keyword/birds/">Joel Sartore's Photo Ark</a> project, and
                        a 400 images from a <a
                            href="https://digital.library.pitt.edu/collection/audubons-birds-america">database of
                            Audubon's drawings</a> from Bird's of America. I'm not sure about the ethics of my data
                        collection. I needed to programmatically scrape images from both sites, is it ok to use the
                        images here?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I first thought that I would do the clustering in image space. While this approach would be
                        the most straightforward, it would based on the contents of the image rather than the
                        features of the bird. For example, a bird facing to the right may be located far from a bird
                        facing to the left as they differ strongly in image space.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To work around this problem, I needed to cluster based on <i>features</i> of the birds in
                        the images rather than on the image data itself. Once again, neural networks come to the
                        rescue. A typical classification network is composed of convolutional feature extractors
                        followed by fully connected layers. These layers of feature extractors at the top of the
                        network start from simple concepts like curves or edges, and build more complex composite
                        feature detectors out of the simpler components. These features can then be used by the
                        fully-connected half of the network to make a classification of what is in the image. To see
                        more on this topic, read this fascinating series on <a
                            href="https://distill.pub/2020/circuits/zoom-in/">Distill.pub</a>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I ran each image through the feature extractor from the VGG16 network to convert a 224x224x3
                        image into a 512x1 dimensional feature output. I then compressed the dimensionality of these
                        vectors from 512 dimensions down to 2 using an algorithm called <a
                            href="https://lvdmaaten.github.io/tsne/">tSNE</a>. From there, the scattered points are
                        moved into a regular grid using a Jonker-Volgenant distance minimization algorithm, and the
                        original image is ploted in its gridded location. This whole process was popularized by <a
                            href="https://cs.stanford.edu/people/karpathy/cnnembed/">Andrej Karpathy</a> and is
                        simply implemented <a href="https://github.com/prabodhhere/tsne-grid">here</a>. All code for
                        the scraping and analysis can be accessed and run in this <a
                            href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/10lKW1_qX40_3ge-iEPhcOfK7AUgFh0aV?usp=sharing">Google
                            Colab notebook</a>.

                    <h5>results</h5>
                    <p>
                        Though some of the trends in the clustering are puzzling to my human eye, the results are
                        quite beautiful! It definitely helps to start with such strong imagery.

                    <h5>conclusion</h5>
                    <p>
                        There's certainly room for improvement on the clustering. However, I think the outputs look
                        wonderful. It's fun to trace how certain features cluster or evolve. For example, look at
                        the red streak on the left side of the Photo Ark compilation, or how the cluster of parrots
                        morph into other birds on the right side.
                    </p>

                    <h5>what would i do next</h5>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            I would be quite curious to use a feature extractor from a network that is made to
                            identify birds. Most of the classes that the VGG16 network predicts are fully unrelated
                            to nature. I would imagine that the clustering would be much more distinct if using a
                            network with features tuned to identify the differences in birds.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            You can see that the the Audubon sketches are cropped, sometimes leaving out important
                            regions. It would be nice to work with a more uniform drawn dataset. Again, Sibley's
                            would be perfect. If anyone has connections to get those images, let me know.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            I'd be curious to incorporate a wide swath of animals in the photo ark. I'd like to see
                            how different species cluster.
                        </li>
