                        using the space-based lidar to find the tallest redwoods
                    </h5>
                    <h5>project goal</h5>
                    <p>
                        The tallest known tree in the world is 380 feet tall (115 m). It's a California coastal redwood
                        tree and is located in Redwood National Park. The tree was found and measured in in 2006, and
                        named <i>Hyperion</i> after the greek Titan of heavenly light. In an attempt to avoid damage
                        from excess tourists or vandalism, the location of the tree is kept a secret among a select few
                        arborists.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In 2019, a new sensor called GEDI (Global Ecosystem Dynamics Instrument) was mounted aboard the
                        International Space Station. Its purpose is to assess forest structure and health from space. I
                        looked to see whether I could use the metrics on tree canopy height from this sensor to find the
                        location of this trees.
                    </p>
                    <h5>methods</h5>
                    <p>
                        GEDI is a Laser Imaging, Detection and Ranging system (LIDAR). As with most ranging systems, it
                        works by pulsing a laser and measuring the time it takes for that light to be reflected. For
                        objects that are further away, the difference in time between the pulse and its return will be
                        greater.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In addition to a single distance metric, LIDAR can also capture density profile characteristics
                        for complex 3D objects. In particular, if a LIDAR beam illuminates a tree canopy, some
                        percentage of the reflected return will come from the tree top, while another portion will come
                        from the ground beneath the canopy. By analyzing the strength of this signal response, we can
                        identify the ground height, the tree canopy density and structure, and the tree canopy height.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Classically, LIDAR systems for forest monitoring have been mounted in an airplane that flies
                        across a region of interest. These scans can be incredibly detailed, but come at a high cost.
                        The GEDI instrument extends the aerial survey concept, but mounts the LIDAR on the International
                        Space Station rather than an aircraft. This allows for continuous measurement of a ground track
                        beneath the orbiting satellite.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To amplify the coverage, GEDI splits the single beam into eight separate components, and takes a
                        measurement from each of these beams. Each of these beams is separted by 600 m. GEDI makes 242
                        measurements per second, and each point of evaluation has a radius of 25 m. These points are
                        separated by 60 m along the path of the orbit.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The first batch of data was released in January of 2020. Given a couple peculariarities in the
                        way the data is structured, it can be challenging to work with. I have fully documented the
                        process in a <a
                            href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1_XhpoMEopDS5bZyyk7nPy15GuxKPvi5_?usp=sharing">Google
                            Colab notebook.</a>
                    </p>
                    <h5>results</h5>
                    <p>
                        The presently available GEDI data contains only a portion of Redwood National Park. From other
                        sources providing information about Hyperion's location, it seems that there is no data coverage
                        from GEDI in that region.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In areas where there is coverage, it is impressive to see the detailed resolution. It seems like
                        we can identify the <a href="https://mdvaden.com/redwood_orion.shtml">Orion Grove</a> in one of
                        the hotspots.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Though I have found no documentation on the topic, I'm curious whether trees taller than 100
                        meters are not picked up by the sensor. In the 1900 measurements meeting the quality thresholds,
                        no tree is taller than 100 meters, and one tree gets suspiciously close at 99.85 m.

                    <h5>conclusion</h5>
                    <p>
                        I continue to be blown away by the remote sensing data that the public can access. Measuring the
                        height of trees worldwide with centimeter precision from space is remarkable, and it amazes me
                        that
                        an average person can access and analyze the data.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I am disappointed that the region of interest needed to find Hyperion is not yet covered by the
                        sensor. That said, the mission continues, and new measurements continue to be added. I'll
                        probably
                        return to this analysis later.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I've also become a bit obsessed with this world of tall trees and peculiar characters who find
                        them.
                        I'm excited to visit Redwood National Forest to see these trees for myself.

                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Re-run this analysis as new data from GEDI is released.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Continue research into whether reported canopy height is limited at 100m.
