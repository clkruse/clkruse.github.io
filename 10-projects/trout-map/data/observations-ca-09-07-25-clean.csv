Lisa Thompson (UC Davis) told me this about the sacred fish:

Rainbow trout and steelhead (trout) are the same species, Oncorhynchus mykiss.   The only difference is that steelhead migrate to the ocean, where food is generally more abundant, so when they return to freshwater to spawn they are larger than the ""resident"" rainbow trout who spend their whole life in freshwater.  The trade-off for the steelhead is that they have to brave the more dangerous ocean conditions, with larger predators, in order to gain the size and reproductive advantage.  The larger the female, the more eggs she produces.

Interestingly, steelhead mothers can produce rainbow trout offspring, and vice versa.  In southern California, where long droughts have occurred historically, this flexibility in life history probably helped the trout to survive.  If the creeks didn't flow enough to break through the lagoon sandbars for many years in a row, any steelhead out in the ocean would have died without reproducing, but the population could have been maintained by the resident rainbow trout in the creek headwaters (e.g., Rattlesnake Creek up above Mission Creek - the first place I saw southern steelhead trout). Once a good rain finally arrived, some of the rainbow trout offspring would have converted to being steelhead, migrated to the ocean, and returned to freshwater large and able to rapidly increase the population size.

In California the steelhead between Santa Cruz and Santa Maria are listed as threatened under the federal ESA, and between Santa Maria and the Mexico border they are listed as endangered.  There are steelhead as far south in California as Camp Pendleton, near Oceanside, and I've seen rainbow trout in the Tijuana River east of San Diego.  There are also a few isolated populations of trout in the highlands of Baja California, and east of the Gulf of California in Mexico.

Finally it disappeared from this small pool on El Corte Madera Creek. Prior to the heavy rain the pool had gotten so small it was apparent the trout had little time to survive without rain. Hopefully it made its return to the sea successfully. While I and other had  spotted it a number of times it was very elusive. The photo here is barely recognizable to anyone but me but it is there.

The second photo includes some young Brook Trout for comparison. They are all about the same size, and all young trout have a line of several dark side patches (parr marks) that fade with age. 

Look for the wormy pattern on the Brook's backs, vs. the spots on the Rainbow. Also the Brooks have a progression of white>black>orange leading edges on their lower fins that the Rainbow lacks. This coloration will become brighter and more distinct with age.

The young Rainbows here at Sagehen also often have a white tip on their dorsal fin like this guy has, but I don't know if that's universal with Rainbow trout.

Rainbow Trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) is a long, slender, ray-finned fish in the Pacific Salmons and Trouts (Oncorhynchus) genus and the Salmons, Trouts, and Whitefishes (Salmonidae) family. ""It is native to cold-water tributaries of the Pacific Ocean. Coloration varies widely based on habitat. Adult fish are distinguished by a broad reddish stripe along the lateral line, from gills to the tail, which is most vivid in breeding males. The name of the genus,  Oncorhynchus, is from the Greek onkos (""hook"") and rynchos (""nose""), in reference to the hooked jaws of males during the mating season."" https://www.inaturalist.org/taxa/47516-Oncorhynchus-mykiss

Animal Diversity Web: https://animaldiversity.org/accounts/Oncorhynchus_mykiss/
""Oncorhynchus mykiss are only native to the Pacific Coast of North America, extending from Alaska down to the border between California and Mexico. However, they have been introduced throughout the United States. and in every continent except for Antarctica for game fishing purposes. There are two forms: freshwater resident and anadromous. The resident form is commonly called rainbow trout while the anadromous form is called steelhead. 
The anadromous form, called steelhead, spawn and complete their early development in freshwater mountain streams, then migrate to spend their adult life in the ocean. In freshwater, they prefer cool water but have been known to tolerate water temperatures up to 24°C (native climates have water temperatures around 12°C in the summer). Productive streams have a good mixture of riffles and pools and overhanging vegetation for shade. Most importantly, they require gravel beds to lay their eggs, and therefore, are sensitive to sedimentation and channel scouring. Juvenile trout prefer protective cover and low velocity water and have been known to be swept away and killed in water that is too fast. Since they are native to the western U.S., then tend to be found in coastal streams and rivers which naturally have reduced flow in summer months. 
Physical description varies widely with sex, age, and habitat. In general, they are streamlined, with 8 to 12 spines in the anal fin and lack teeth at the base of the tongue (unlike their close relatives, Oncorhynchus clarkii). The undersides tend to be silvery with a pinkish red stripe along the upper-middle part of the body, though this stripe can vary from dark to light. Resident rainbows and spawning steelhead tend to be lighter with more pronounced pink stripes, while ocean-going steelhead are darker and silvery to blend into their ocean environment. Most have black spots above the lateral line, and resident rainbows tend to have more intense spotting, well below the lateral line."" https://animaldiversity.org/accounts/Oncorhynchus_mykiss/

""Rarely has anyone ever been so excited by news of a dead fish. On Nov. 2, James Robinson, executive director of the Lake Merritt Institute, got a call from a board member saying someone saw a large salmon-looking fish jumping out of the water. Unsure of the validity of the claim, Robinson eagerly awaited confirmation. Soon the reports came in: Several salmon carcasses had washed ashore on Lake Merritt. Robinson was thrilled.

“This is only the second time since I’ve been at the institute that Chinook salmon have been in the lake,” said Robinson. “It’s so many obstacles for [them] to get here, and that’s why it’s so fascinating.” ...

Another local stewardship group, Rotary Nature Center Friends, has also been following the salmon return closely. The organization received a permit from the California Department of Fish and Wildlife to conduct scientific work at Lake Merritt, including the collection of the deceased salmon for observational and educational purposes. Around a week ago, Katie Noonan, founder of the organization, received reports and photos of the salmon from one of her group’s volunteers, who monitor the conditions of the lake for occurrences such as these. She quickly went out to retrieve samples.""

Rainbow Trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) is a long, slender, ray-finned fish in the Pacific Salmons and Trouts (Oncorhynchus) genus and the Salmons, Trouts, and Whitefishes (Salmonidae) family. ""It is native to cold-water tributaries of the Pacific Ocean. Coloration varies widely based on habitat. Adult fish are distinguished by a broad reddish stripe along the lateral line, from gills to the tail, which is most vivid in breeding males. The name of the genus, Oncorhynchus, is from the Greek onkos (""hook"") and rynchos (""nose""), in reference to the hooked jaws of males during the mating season."" https://www.inaturalist.org/taxa/47516-Oncorhynchus-mykiss

Animal Diversity Web: https://animaldiversity.org/accounts/Oncorhynchus_mykiss/
""Oncorhynchus mykiss are only native to the Pacific Coast of North America, extending from Alaska down to the border between California and Mexico. However, they have been introduced throughout the United States. and in every continent except for Antarctica for game fishing purposes. There are two forms: freshwater resident and anadromous. The resident form is commonly called rainbow trout while the anadromous form is called steelhead.
The anadromous form, called steelhead, spawn and complete their early development in freshwater mountain streams, then migrate to spend their adult life in the ocean. In freshwater, they prefer cool water but have been known to tolerate water temperatures up to 24°C (native climates have water temperatures around 12°C in the summer). Productive streams have a good mixture of riffles and pools and overhanging vegetation for shade. Most importantly, they require gravel beds to lay their eggs, and therefore, are sensitive to sedimentation and channel scouring. Juvenile trout prefer protective cover and low velocity water and have been known to be swept away and killed in water that is too fast. Since they are native to the western U.S., then tend to be found in coastal streams and rivers which naturally have reduced flow in summer months.
Physical description varies widely with sex, age, and habitat. In general, they are streamlined, with 8 to 12 spines in the anal fin and lack teeth at the base of the tongue (unlike their close relatives, Oncorhynchus clarkii). The undersides tend to be silvery with a pinkish red stripe along the upper-middle part of the body, though this stripe can vary from dark to light. Resident rainbows and spawning steelhead tend to be lighter with more pronounced pink stripes, while ocean-going steelhead are darker and silvery to blend into their ocean environment. Most have black spots above the lateral line, and resident rainbows tend to have more intense spotting, well below the lateral line."" https://animaldiversity.org/accounts/Oncorhynchus_mykiss/

Rainbow Trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) is a long, slender, ray-finned fish in the Pacific Salmons and Trouts (Oncorhynchus) genus and the Salmons, Trouts, and Whitefishes (Salmonidae) family. ""It is native to cold-water tributaries of the Pacific Ocean. Coloration varies widely based on habitat. Adult fish are distinguished by a broad reddish stripe along the lateral line, from gills to the tail, which is most vivid in breeding males. The name of the genus, Oncorhynchus, is from the Greek onkos (""hook"") and rynchos (""nose""), in reference to the hooked jaws of males during the mating season."" https://www.inaturalist.org/taxa/47516-Oncorhynchus-mykiss

Animal Diversity Web: https://animaldiversity.org/accounts/Oncorhynchus_mykiss/
""Oncorhynchus mykiss are only native to the Pacific Coast of North America, extending from Alaska down to the border between California and Mexico. However, they have been introduced throughout the United States. and in every continent except for Antarctica for game fishing purposes. There are two forms: freshwater resident and anadromous. The resident form is commonly called rainbow trout while the anadromous form is called steelhead.
The anadromous form, called steelhead, spawn and complete their early development in freshwater mountain streams, then migrate to spend their adult life in the ocean. In freshwater, they prefer cool water but have been known to tolerate water temperatures up to 24°C (native climates have water temperatures around 12°C in the summer). Productive streams have a good mixture of riffles and pools and overhanging vegetation for shade. Most importantly, they require gravel beds to lay their eggs, and therefore, are sensitive to sedimentation and channel scouring. Juvenile trout prefer protective cover and low velocity water and have been known to be swept away and killed in water that is too fast. Since they are native to the western U.S., then tend to be found in coastal streams and rivers which naturally have reduced flow in summer months.
Physical description varies widely with sex, age, and habitat. In general, they are streamlined, with 8 to 12 spines in the anal fin and lack teeth at the base of the tongue (unlike their close relatives, Oncorhynchus clarkii). The undersides tend to be silvery with a pinkish red stripe along the upper-middle part of the body, though this stripe can vary from dark to light. Resident rainbows and spawning steelhead tend to be lighter with more pronounced pink stripes, while ocean-going steelhead are darker and silvery to blend into their ocean environment. Most have black spots above the lateral line, and resident rainbows tend to have more intense spotting, well below the lateral line."" https://animaldiversity.org/accounts/Oncorhynchus_mykiss/
